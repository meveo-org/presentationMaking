      "since this vote counting is performed offchain by each organizer"
      "they have to provide a formal proof that each voter voted once, "
      "was part of the registered voters and that the counting has been performed correctly."
      "To achieve this, the counting algorithm is coded in cairo, 
      "a language that allows to write programs for which we easily compute a proof."
      "Each organizer creates such a program with hints, hints the part he only sees, containing
      the voters Ids, vote result and voter's signature"
      "the proof is then computed and published by the organizers."
      "finally they mutually sign a transaction sent to the id of the proposal,
       id which is in fact a genuine XRP Account address, containing the counting of the votes of each"
       "organizer and a hash of their proof"
       "Once written in the XRP Ledger, each voter has the ability to check the result of the vote"
       "and to verify that its personal vote has been correctly accounted for."
